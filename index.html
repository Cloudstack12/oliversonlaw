                    Domestic violence is a serious offense designation in Arizona that has long-term and severe penalties. The statute that defines domestic violence is <a href="https://www.shouselaw.com/az/defense/laws/domestic-violence/">ARS 13-3601</a> , with its violation being tried as a felony or misdemeanor. Arizona prosecutes this crime aggressively and has adopted a ‘Victim Bill of Rights’. The legal punishment depends on the degree of offense for which the accused is convicted. This can range from emotional to sexual abuse against the victim. To give you a better idea, this article will cover the main aspects of domestic violence and what it entails.

                Whether it is in <b>Scottsdale</b>, <b>Tempe</b>, <b>Phoenix</b>,<b>Mesa</b>, <b>Gilbert</b>, <b>or Kingman</b> most cases of domestic violence are not solved quickly.
